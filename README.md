### üîí Security & Privacy Explained

**For IT Teams:**
- OAuth app acts as the application identifier only
- No service accounts or shared drives needed
- Each user's token is stored locally on their machine
- Tokens are isolated per user in `~/.docugen/token.json`
- No central storage or logging of user documents

**For Employees:**
- You sign in with YOUR Google account
- You see only YOUR documents
- Your access token stays on YOUR computer
- Even though everyone uses the same OAuth app, each person's login determines their access

**Simple Analogy:** 
Think of the OAuth app like your company's email server. Everyone uses the same email server (OAuth app), but each person logs in with their own credentials and can only see their own emails (documents).

### üìä Deployment Checklist for IT

- [ ] Created Google Cloud project
- [ ] Enabled Google Docs and Drive APIs
- [ ] Created OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
- [ ] Saved CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET
- [ ] Created configuration template for employees
- [ ] Sent setup instructions to team
- [ ] Tested with one pilot user
- [ ] Rolled out to all employees

### üÜò Enterprise Support

#### For IT Teams

**Can we restrict which employees can use this?**  
Yes. In Google Cloud Console, configure your OAuth consent screen to limit access by domain or specific user groups in your Google Workspace.

**How do we monitor usage?**  
Google Cloud Console provides detailed API usage metrics. Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Metrics to view request counts, error rates, and quota usage.

**Can employees access shared drives?**  
Yes. Employees can access any shared drives they have permissions for in Google Workspace. DocuGen respects existing Google Drive permissions.

**What happens when an employee leaves?**  
No action required. When their Google account is deactivated, their local token automatically becomes invalid and they lose access.

#### For Employees

**MCP server not appearing in AI assistant**  
‚Ä¢ Completely quit and restart your AI assistant  
‚Ä¢ Verify the configuration was saved correctly  
‚Ä¢ Check that Node.js is installed: run `node --version` in terminal

**Browser doesn't open for Google sign-in**  
‚Ä¢ Run `npx docugen-mcp` directly in your terminal  
‚Ä¢ Check if your default browser is set correctly  
‚Ä¢ Ensure you're not on a remote/headless system

**"Authentication failed" error**  
‚Ä¢ Delete the token file: `rm ~/.docugen/token.json` (Mac/Linux) or delete `%USERPROFILE%\.docugen\token.json` (Windows)  
‚Ä¢ Restart your AI assistant and try again  
‚Ä¢ Ensure you're signing in with your company Google account

**Can't see or create documents**  
‚Ä¢ Verify you signed in with your company Google account (not personal)  
‚Ä¢ Check with IT that Google Docs API is enabled  
‚Ä¢ Ensure you have Google Workspace access

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues

**No credentials found**  
‚Ä¢ For individual users: Verify `credentials.json` exists at the path specified in GOOGLE_OAUTH_PATH  
‚Ä¢ For enterprise: Check that GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are set correctly  
‚Ä¢ Use forward slashes (/) in paths, even on Windows

**APIs not enabled**  
‚Ä¢ Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Library  
‚Ä¢ Search for "Google Docs API" and "Google Drive API"  
‚Ä¢ Ensure both show "API Enabled" with a green checkmark

**MCP server not appearing**  
‚Ä¢ Quit your AI assistant completely (not just close the window)  
‚Ä¢ Validate JSON syntax using a JSON validator  
‚Ä¢ Check file permissions: the config file should be readable

### Authentication Issues

**Browser doesn't open for sign-in**  
‚Ä¢ Try running `npx docugen-mcp` directly in terminal to test  
‚Ä¢ Check your default browser is set in system settings  
‚Ä¢ For remote systems, you'll need to use credentials.json method

**Token expired or revoked**  
‚Ä¢ Delete the token file: `~/.docugen/token.json`  
‚Ä¢ Restart your AI assistant to trigger re-authentication  
‚Ä¢ Verify the OAuth app is still active in Google Cloud Console

### Runtime Issues

**Can't create or access documents**  
‚Ä¢ Ensure you're signed in with the correct Google account  
‚Ä¢ Verify you have edit permissions for Google Docs  
‚Ä¢ Check quota limits in Google Cloud Console (free tier: 60 requests/minute)

**"Permission denied" errors**  
‚Ä¢ For shared drives: verify you have access in Google Drive  
‚Ä¢ For personal docs: ensure you're the owner or have edit access  
‚Ä¢ Check OAuth consent screen includes required scopes
