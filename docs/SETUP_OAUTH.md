# Setting Up Google OAuth for DocuGen - Complete Guide

This guide will walk you through creating Google OAuth credentials step-by-step. No technical knowledge required!

## üìã What You'll Need

- A Google account (personal or workspace)
- 5 minutes of time
- A web browser

## üéØ What We're Doing

We're creating credentials that allow DocuGen to:
- Create Google Docs in your account
- List and search your documents
- Format and update documents

**Important**: You control access - you can revoke it anytime from your Google account settings.

2. Find and click on **"DocuGen"** in the list

## Step 3: Enable Required Google APIs

We need to enable two APIs that let DocuGen work with Google Docs.

### 3.1 Open the API Library

## Step 4: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

Before creating credentials, Google needs some basic info about your app.

### 4.1 Go to OAuth Consent Screen

1. In the left sidebar, click **"OAuth consent screen"**

### 4.2 Choose User Type

You'll see two options:
- **Internal**: Only if you have Google Workspace

Click **"CREATE"**

### 4.3 Fill in App Information

**Required fields only:**

1. **App name**: `DocuGen MCP`
2. **User support email**: Select your email from dropdown
3. **Developer contact information**: Enter your email again

**Skip everything else** - just scroll down

Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"**

### 4.4 Scopes (Permissions)

1. Click **"ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"**
2. In the filter box, search for `docs`
3. Check the box for:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`
4. Search for `drive`
5. Check the box for:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
6. Click **"UPDATE"** at the bottom
7. Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"**

### 4.5 Test Users (Optional)

## Step 5: Create OAuth Credentials

Now we create the actual credentials file.

### 5.1 Go to Credentials Page

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Credentials"**

### 5.2 Create OAuth Client ID

1. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** button at the top
2. Select **"OAuth client ID"**

### 5.3 Configure the OAuth Client

1. **Application type**: Select **"Desktop app"**
2. **Name**: `DocuGen Desktop`
3. Click **"CREATE"**

### 5.4 Download Your Credentials

A popup will appear showing your client ID and secret.

1. Click **"DOWNLOAD JSON"** button
2. Save the file somewhere you'll remember (like Downloads folder)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Rename the file to exactly: `credentials.json`

> üìÅ **Tip**: Create a folder called `docugen` in your home directory and put the file there

---

## Step 6: Place the Credentials File

### For Windows Users

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\YourUsername\`
3. Create a new folder called `docugen`
4. Move `credentials.json` into this folder

**Final path**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\docugen\credentials.json`

### For Mac Users

1. Open Finder
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + G`
3. Type: `~/` and press Enter
4. Create a new folder called `docugen`
5. Move `credentials.json` into this folder

**Final path**: `/Users/YourUsername/docugen/credentials.json`

### For Linux Users

1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `mkdir ~/docugen`
3. Move the file: `mv ~/Downloads/credentials.json ~/docugen/`

**Final path**: `/home/YourUsername/docugen/credentials.json`

---

## ‚úÖ You're Done!

You now have OAuth credentials set up. The path to use in your configuration is:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\docugen\credentials.json`
- **Mac**: `/Users/YourUsername/docugen/credentials.json`
- **Linux**: `/home/YourUsername/docugen/credentials.json`

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username.

---

## üîí Security Notes

- **Keep credentials.json private** - Don't share this file with anyone
- **Don't commit to git** - It's already in .gitignore
- **You can revoke access anytime** at [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Project not found" error
- Make sure you selected the DocuGen project in the dropdown at the top

### Can't find APIs to enable
- Use the search box in the API Library
- Make sure you're in the right project

### "Unauthorized" error later
- Check that both APIs are enabled
- Verify credentials.json is in the right location
- Try downloading credentials.json again

### Need to start over?
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Select the DocuGen project
3. Click Settings ‚Üí Shut down project
