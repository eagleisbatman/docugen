# Missing Features in Current Sheets MCP Implementation

## Critical Missing Features

### 1. Complete BatchUpdate Support
Our current implementation is missing 50+ request types! We only have basic operations.

**Missing Request Types:**
- Data validation rules
- Protected ranges (we have stub but not implementation)

- Text to columns
- Randomize range
- Auto-resize dimensions
- Embedded object management
- Filter views (we only have basic filter)

### 2. Pivot Tables

Current implementation is incomplete. Missing:
- Support for all 15+ chart types
- Proper chart positioning
- Series configuration
- Axis customization
- Trendlines
- Error bars

### 4. Data Validation
Completely missing! Need to add:
- List validation
- Number range validation
- Date validation
- Text length validation
- Custom formula validation
- Checkbox validation

### 5. Conditional Formatting
Only has stub implementation. Need:
- Color scales/gradients
- Data bars
- Icon sets
- Custom formulas
- Multiple conditions

### 6. Advanced Formula Features
Missing:
- Array formulas
- Named ranges in formulas
- Cross-sheet references
- QUERY function support
- IMPORTRANGE support

### 7. Filtering and Views
Missing:
- Filter views (save multiple filters)
- Sort specs within filters
- Filter criteria (not just basic)

### 8. Protection and Collaboration
Missing:
- Sheet protection
- Range protection with editors
- Warning-only protection
- Protected range descriptions

### 9. Import/Export
Missing:
- Import CSV/TSV
- Export to various formats
- Import from other sheets (IMPORTRANGE)

### 10. Data Sources
Completely missing:
- BigQuery connections
- External database connections
- Refresh schedules
- Data source parameters

### 11. Performance Features
Missing:
- Batch operations optimization
- Partial response fields
- Include spreadsheet in response options
- Grid data in responses

### 12. Formatting Options
Incomplete:
- Number formats (currency, percent, date)
- Text rotation
- Cell padding
- Hyperlinks
- Rich text within cells
- Wrap strategies

### 13. Sheet Properties
Missing:
- Tab colors
- Hidden sheets
- Right-to-left sheets
- Grid properties
- Frozen rows/columns

### 14. Advanced Operations
Missing:
- Find and replace with regex
- Sort with multiple columns
- Auto-fill with patterns
- Smart fill
- Dimension groups (grouped rows/columns)

## Comparison with Google Docs MCP
The Docs server had 43+ operations, but many were document-specific.
The Sheets API has 60+ request types plus values operations, making it MORE complex!

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Operations (Current)
✅ Basic read/write
✅ Basic formulas
✅ Simple sheets management
✅ Basic financial model
⚠️ Basic charts (incomplete)

### Phase 2: Essential Missing Features
- [ ] Data validation
- [ ] Complete conditional formatting
- [ ] Protected ranges
- [ ] Proper pivot tables
- [ ] All chart types
- [ ] Named ranges
- [ ] Filter views

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Data sources
- [ ] Slicers
- [ ] Banding
- [ ] Developer metadata
- [ ] Import/Export
- [ ] Advanced formulas

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- [ ] BigQuery integration
- [ ] External databases
- [ ] Collaboration features
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Version history

## Conclusion
Our current implementation covers maybe 20% of the Sheets API capabilities.
To be truly comprehensive, we need to add support for all 60+ request types and properly implement complex features like pivot tables, data validation, and charts.
