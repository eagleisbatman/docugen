## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "create a spreadsheet", say "create an expense tracker with categories"

2. **Provide Context**: Explain what the spreadsheet is for and who will use it

3. **Include Sample Data**: When importing data, paste a few rows as examples

4. **Specify Formatting**: Mention if you want specific colors, fonts, or styles

5. **Request Features**: Ask for dropdowns, formulas, charts if you need them

## What You Can't Do

- Access files on your computer (must paste data as text)
- Delete entire spreadsheets (can only clear content)
- Share or change permissions (done in Google Sheets)
- Access other Google services (only Sheets)

## Pro Tips

- Start simple and add features incrementally
- Test with sample data before importing everything
- Use templates for recurring reports
- Request data validation to prevent errors
- Ask for charts to visualize data better
