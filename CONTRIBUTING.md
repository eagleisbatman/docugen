### Creating Templates

One of the easiest ways to contribute is by creating new document templates:

1. Create a new JSON file in the appropriate category folder
2. Follow the template structure defined in the documentation
3. Test your template thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with your template

Template structure example:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-template-id",
  "name": "Template Display Name",
  "description": "What this template is for",
  "category": "category-name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "sections": [
    // Template sections here
  ]
}
```

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** if applicable
4. **Ensure the test suite passes** (when available)
5. **Run the build** to make sure everything compiles
6. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs
7. **Write a good commit message** following conventional commits

#### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the CLAUDE.md file if you've made architectural changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await over callbacks

### Template Guidelines

- Templates should be generic and reusable
- Use clear, descriptive placeholder names
- Include all necessary sections for the document type
- Test with various data inputs
- Document any special requirements
